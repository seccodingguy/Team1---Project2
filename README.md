# Meat Consumption Prediction

## Title: "Predicting the Future of Food: An Introduction to Meat Consumption Prediction"
### Content to include:
## Why is meat consumption prediction important? (Food security, environmental impact, economic planning)
## Overview of the Meat Consumption Predictor application and its goals.
## High-level explanation of the technologies used (scikit-learn, Pandas, GridSearchCV).
## Briefly introduce the machine learning models (Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge).

## Summary

The goal of this research is to use machine learning techniques to assess and forecast patterns in meat consumption. To anticipate future trends of meat consumption, the Jupyter Notebook **MeatConsumptionPrediction.ipynb** uses predictive modeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data preprocessing.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistical insights into meat consumption trends.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implements machine learning models to forecast meat consumption.
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance assessment using appropriate metrics.

## Installation
There are two paths to install and run the prediction model.

### Interactive Web Application

The interactive web application will generate predictions from selected parameters by the user. The details of how to install and configure the interactive web application is here:

#### Jupyter Notebook

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, manually install key libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MeatConsumptionPrediction.git
   cd MeatConsumptionPrediction
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MeatConsumptionPrediction.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells sequentially to process the data, visualize trends, and make predictions.

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project contains historical meat consumption data from various sources. Dataset origin: [Consumption of Meat Per Capita Dataset](Consumption%20of%20meat%20per%20capita.csv)


## Models Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Neural Networks (if applicable)**

## Findings

- Important conclusions drawn from the data.
- A comparison of the model's performance.
- Trends in meat consumption were predicted.

- ## Upcoming Enhancements

- Add other elements, such as food habits or economic factors.
- Improve model performance by fine-tuning the hyperparameters.
- Investigate deep learning models to increase precision.
